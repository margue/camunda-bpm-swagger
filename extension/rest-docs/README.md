# Rest Docs


src/main/resources/rest contains the content/reference/rest part of the
current (7.7.0) camunda-docs.

This was downloaded manually from github via https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs-manual/archive/7.7.0.zip


TODO: this should be automated via maven-download to support multiple versions.
